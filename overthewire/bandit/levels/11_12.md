#### Task:

As stated and, hinted on OTW: _The password for the next level is stored in the file **data.txt**, where all lowercase (a-z) and uppercase (A-Z) letters have been rotated by 13 positions_.

Perform the necessary task to advance to next level, making the use of [`tr`](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/tr.1.html) command, and redirections.

#### Explanation
Julius Caesar loved secret codes—and his friend Brutus (whose name sounds like “brute”) famously stabbed him while he uttered “Et tu, Brute? Then fall, Caesar!”—a line that inspired the idea of a simple letter-shift, now called the Caesar cipher ([Et tu, Brute? - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Et_tu%2C_Brute%3F?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [Why did Shakespeare make Julius Caesar's last words the Latin 'Et ...](https://www.theguardian.com/notesandqueries/query/0%2C5753%2C-1156%2C00.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)). ROT13 is just that cipher with a shift of 13, so doing it twice gets you back to your original text ([Caesar cipher | History, Method, Examples, Security, & Facts](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Caesar-cipher?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [The Encryption System Used by Julius Caesar in his Letters to Hide ...](https://www.labrujulaverde.com/en/2024/03/the-encryption-system-used-by-julius-caesar-in-his-letters-to-hide-their-content/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)). We even joke that “Brutus” sounds like “brute-forcing,” which in modern cryptography means trying every shift until you crack the code ([Are Caesars last words a pun? - shakespeare - Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/shakespeare/comments/1fy4lcf/are_caesars_last_words_a_pun/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

##### Julius, Brutus, and “Et tu, Brute?”

In Shakespeare’s play, Caesar is surrounded by senators and sees his friend Brutus among them—he gasps “Et tu, Brute? Then fall, Caesar!” as the final betrayal ([Et tu, Brute? - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Et_tu%2C_Brute%3F?utm_source=chatgpt.com)). Historically this line comes from dramatic retellings, not eyewitness quotes—but it perfectly captures the twist that Caesar’s own code (and his trust) was undone from within ([Last words of Julius Caesar - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_words_of_Julius_Caesar?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

##### The Caesar Cipher & ROT13

A **Caesar cipher** shifts each letter by a fixed number _n_ in the alphabet—Caesar reportedly used _n_=3 to hide military orders ([The Story of Cryptography: History - GhostVolt](https://www.ghostvolt.com/articles/cryptography_history.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [Caesar cipher - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher?utm_source=chatgpt.com)). **ROT13** fixes _n_=13 so that encoding and decoding are the same step—A↔N, B↔O, …, M↔Z ([Caesar cipher | History, Method, Examples, Security, & Facts](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Caesar-cipher?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [The Encryption System Used by Julius Caesar in his Letters to Hide ...](https://www.labrujulaverde.com/en/2024/03/the-encryption-system-used-by-julius-caesar-in-his-letters-to-hide-their-content/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

##### The “Brute-forcing” Pun

Since “Brutus” sounds like “brute,” we quip that breaking a Caesar cipher by trying every shift is “Brute-forcing it”—a playful nod to betrayal in code form ([Are Caesars last words a pun? - shakespeare - Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/shakespeare/comments/1fy4lcf/are_caesars_last_words_a_pun/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

##### One-Line ROT13 with `tr`

```bash
echo "Hello, World!" | tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m'  # Uryyb, Jbeyq!

```

This rotates each letter by 13 (leaving punctuation alone), and spits out the playful “Uryyb, Jbeyq!” version of “Hello, World!” ([Caesar Cipher Help : r/learnprogramming - Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/2mn9ky/caesar_cipher_help/?ref=search_posts&utm_source=chatgpt.com), [Et Tu, Brute? in Julius Caesar | Definition, Speaker & Context - Lesson](https://study.com/academy/lesson/et-tu-brute-definition-meaning-quiz.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).
