#### Previously learnt:
SSH Connect to remote host on a custom port, made use of `sort` and `uniq` command to see the password of this level by checking if it's the only line of text that occurs only once.

---
#### Task:

As stated and, hinted on OTW: _The password for the next level is stored in the file  **data.txt**  in one of the few human-readable strings, preceded by several ‚Äò=‚Äô characters_. Perform the necessary task to advance to next level, making the use of [`grep`](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/grep.1.html), and [`strings`](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/strings.1.html) command

#### Explanation
##### What Is `grep`?

`grep` stands for ‚Äúglobally search for a regular expression and print‚Äù and its job is to look through text and show you only the lines that match what you‚Äôre looking for ([grep command in Unix/Linux | GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/grep-command-in-unixlinux/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)). It‚Äôs like asking a robot to read every page of a book and shout out only when it sees the word you asked for ([Mastering Grep command in Linux/Unix: A Beginner's Tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/grep-command-in-linux-unix?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

##### Basic Usage

-   **Search a single file**
    
    ```bash
    grep "hello" file.txt
    
    ```
    
    The robot reads `file.txt` and prints only the lines that contain ‚Äúhello‚Äù ([How to use the grep command in Linux + examples - Hostinger](https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/grep-command-in-linux?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).
    
-   **Search multiple files**
    
    ```bash
    grep "error" *.log
    
    ```
    
    It looks in every file ending with `.log` and shows lines with ‚Äúerror‚Äù ([The Linux Grep Command Tutorial With Examples For Beginners](https://ostechnix.com/the-grep-command-tutorial-with-examples-for-beginners/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).
    
-   **Case-insensitive search**
    
    ```bash
    grep -i "warning" file.txt
    
    ```
    
    The `-i` flag makes it ignore uppercase vs lowercase, so ‚ÄúWarning‚Äù or ‚Äúwarning‚Äù both match ([Use the Linux grep Command - Rackspace](https://docs.rackspace.com/docs/use-the-linux-grep-command?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).
    
-   **Show line numbers**
    
    ```bash
    grep -n "TODO" code.c
    
    ```
    
    The `-n` flag prints the line number before each matching line, like ‚Äú42: TODO fix this‚Äù ([Grep Command in Linux ‚Äì Usage, Options, and Syntax Examples](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/grep-command-in-linux-usage-options-and-syntax-examples/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).
    

##### Why It‚Äôs Handy

-   Quickly find typos or error messages in logs.
    
-   Search through code to find where a function is used.
    
-   Filter command output (e.g. `dmesg \| grep usb`) to see only USB-related messages.

##### What Is `strings`?

The `strings` command scans a file (even a binary) and pulls out all the little human-readable words (‚Äústrings‚Äù) it finds‚Äîlike using a flashlight to spot only the letters hidden inside a toy robot‚Äôs insides ([Strings (Unix)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strings_%28Unix%29?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

##### Why Use It?

-   **Peek inside binaries**: See error messages or labels embedded in programs without running them ([Strings (Unix)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strings_%28Unix%29?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).
    
-   **Inspect crash dumps**: Extract readable notes from memory dumps to help debug ([STRINGS command line help : r/linux4noobs - Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux4noobs/comments/tqo1g1/strings_command_line_help/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).
    
-   **Find hidden text**: Reveal comments or configuration data inside non-text files ([How to Use the strings Command on Linux - How-To Geek](https://www.howtogeek.com/427805/how-to-use-the-strings-command-on-linux/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).
    

##### How It Works, ELI5

1.  **Scan for letters**: It looks for runs of at least 4 printable characters by default (you can change that) ([Strings (Unix)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strings_%28Unix%29?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).
    
2.  **Ignore gibberish**: Everything else (binary noise) is skipped.
    
3.  **Print what‚Äôs left**: You get just the readable words, line by line.
    

##### Basic Usage

Task

Command

What Happens

Show strings in a file

`strings file.bin`

Lists all readable words ‚â•4 chars in `file.bin` ([Strings (Unix)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strings_%28Unix%29?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

Change minimum length to 8

`strings -n 8 file.bin`

Now only shows words ‚â•8 chars ([Strings (Unix)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strings_%28Unix%29?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

Pipe from another command

`dd if=/dev/mem ‚Ä¶ | strings -n 8`

Reads memory, then shows ‚â•8-char strings ([Strings (Unix)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strings_%28Unix%29?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

Redirect errors away

`strings file 2>/dev/null`

Hide error messages, show only strings ([STRINGS command line help : r/linux4noobs - Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux4noobs/comments/tqo1g1/strings_command_line_help/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

Analyze only initialized sections

`strings -a file`

Include all sections, not just loaded ones ([Strings (Unix)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strings_%28Unix%29?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

##### Quick Example

Imagine you have a mysterious file `mystery.bin`. To see any hidden words inside it:

```bash
strings mystery.bin

```

You might see things like:

```
VERSION
Error: file not found
Hello, world!

```

Those are the ‚Äústrings‚Äù‚Äîthe only parts made of regular letters that `strings` could find and print ([Strings (Unix)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strings_%28Unix%29?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

----------

Basically, `strings` is your flashlight for spotting text buried inside files! üòä
