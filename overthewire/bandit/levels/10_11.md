#### Previously learnt:
SSH Connect to remote host on a custom port, made use of `strings` and `grep` command to grep `=` for obtaining the password of this level.

---
#### Task:

As stated and, hinted on OTW: _The password for the next level is stored in the file  **data.txt**, which contains base64 encoded data_. Perform the necessary task to advance to next level, making the use of [`base64`](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/base64.1.html) command.

#### Explanation
##### What Is Base64?

Base64 is a way to turn any “blob” of data—pictures, music, or code—into just letters, numbers, and a few symbols so it can safely travel through systems that only understand text ([Why do we use Base64? - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3538021/why-do-we-use-base64?utm_source=chatgpt.com)). It works by taking each group of 3 bytes (24 bits) and splitting them into 4 groups of 6 bits, then mapping those 6-bit values to 64 printable characters (A–Z, a–z, 0–9, “+”, “/”) ([Base64 Encoding, Explained - Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37981939&utm_source=chatgpt.com)). If the data doesn’t divide evenly into 3-byte chunks, it pads the end with “=” so the receiver knows to strip extra bits off ([ELI5: Base64 encoding : r/explainlikeimfive - Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/27a5pn/eli5_base64_encoding/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

##### Why Use It?

Many email systems, HTTP headers, or JSON APIs only handle plain text—Base64 lets you squeeze binary files into that text box without corruption ([Why do we use Base64? - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3538021/why-do-we-use-base64?utm_source=chatgpt.com)). It’s also the backbone of HTTP Basic Auth (you send “username:password” as Base64) and embedding small images directly in HTML or CSS (data URIs) ([Linux Command Line Base64 Encoding and Decoding of Strings](https://www.baeldung.com/linux/cli-base64-encode-decode?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

##### Basic Linux `base64` Command

-   **Encode a file:**
    
    ```bash
    base64 input.bin > output.txt
    
    ```
    
    This reads `input.bin`, converts to Base64 text, and writes to `output.txt` ([base64 command in linux - Scaler Topics](https://www.scaler.com/topics/base64-command-in-linux/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).
    
-   **Encode a string:**
    
    ```bash
    echo -n "hello" | base64
    # aGVsbG8=
    ```
    
-   **Decode Base64 back to binary/text:**
    
    ```bash
    $ echo "aGVsbG8=" | base64 -d
    hello
    ```

#### Solution
```bash
$ sshpass -p FGUW5ilLVJrxX9kMYMmlN4MgbpfMiqey ssh bandit10@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
# type, and enter "yes" (without quotes, if necessary)
                         _                     _ _ _
                        | |__   __ _ _ __   __| (_) |_
                        | '_ \ / _` | '_ \ / _` | | __|
                        | |_) | (_| | | | | (_| | | |_
                        |_.__/ \__,_|_| |_|\__,_|_|\__|
