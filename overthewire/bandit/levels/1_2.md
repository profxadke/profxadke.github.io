#### Task:

Read file named `-` making use of `cat` command.

---
#### Explanation

Here, we're supposed to read the file making the use of wildcards, or anything that substitutes `-` as a command-line argument (filename) to `cat` command since it is used to already parse command-line argument.

```bash
$ sshpass -p ZjLjTmM6FvvyRnrb2rfNWOZOTa6ip5If ssh bandit1@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
# type, and enter "yes" (without quotes, if necessary)
                         _                     _ _ _
