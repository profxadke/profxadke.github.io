SSH Connect to remote host on a custom port, and then read `-` filename making use of `cat` command.

#### Task:

Read file named `spaces\ in\ this\ filename` making use of `cat` command.

---
#### Explanation

Here, we're supposed to read the file making the use of wildcards, or anything that substitutes `spaces in this filename` (like: escaping it: `spaces\ in\ this\ filename` as a command-line argument (filename) to `cat` command since space is used to separate command-line argument.
