None.

#### Task:
Connect to SSH on specified host, and port with the given credentials. Then, read contents of `readme` file, to advance to level 1 with the provided credentials.

---
#### Explanation

-   **SSH** is like a secret tunnel to another computer; you can even tell it to use a different door (port).
    
-   **Ports** are doors numbered on a computer; the default SSH door is 22, but you can pick another (e.g. 2222).
    
-   **`cat`** is like a robot that reads pages (files or streams) out loud, one after another (“concatenating”) and shows you the combined text.
    
-   **Buffers** are little mailbags that hold data before it’s delivered to you (STDOUT) or marked as errors (STDERR).
    

----------

##### 1. What Is SSH?

SSH (Secure Shell) lets you open a secure “tunnel” from your computer into another—so you can type commands there as if you were sitting in front of it. It scrambles (encrypts) everything you send, so spies can’t read your password or your files as they travel.

###### 1.1 Default vs. Custom Port

-   **Port** = door number on the computer’s network “house.”
    
-   **Default SSH door** is 22.
    
-   **Custom port** means “please use door 2222 (or any number you pick)” instead.
    

```bash
ssh -p 2222 user@remote.example.com

```

Here `-p 2222` tells SSH “knock on door 2222 instead of 22.”

----------

##### 2. What Is `cat`?

`cat` stands for “concatenate.” Imagine you have two storybooks and you want one long story—you ask the robot `cat` to read book 1, then book 2, back to back. It prints both in one continuous stream.

```bash
cat file1.txt file2.txt

```

This shows you all of file1, then all of file2.

###### 2.1 Buffers, STDOUT, and STDERR

-   **STDOUT** (standard output) is the robot’s normal speaking voice.
    
-   **STDERR** (standard error) is its alarm voice (when something goes wrong).
    
-   **Buffer** = its little backstage tray holding words before they’re spoken.
    

When you run `cat`, it reads each file into its buffer, then speaks that buffer to STDOUT.

----------

##### 3. Example: Concatenating Buffers to STDOUT

Imagine you have two short files:

-   **greeting.txt** contains “Hello,”
    
-   **name.txt** contains “Alice!”
    

```bash
cat greeting.txt name.txt
# Output: Hello, Alice!

```

Under the hood:

1.  `cat` reads “Hello,” into buffer A.
    
2.  It sends buffer A to STDOUT (you see “Hello,”).
    
3.  It reads “Alice!” into buffer B.
    
4.  It sends buffer B to STDOUT (you see “Alice!” right after).
    

----------

##### 4. Reading from Pipes (stdout)

You can also pipe another command’s STDOUT into `cat`:

```bash
echo "Surprise!" | cat
# Output: Surprise!

```

Here:

1.  `echo` writes “Surprise!” into its STDOUT buffer.
    
2.  The pipe (`|`) connects echo’s STDOUT to cat’s STDIN.
    
3.  `cat` reads that buffer from its STDIN and writes it to its STDOUT.
    

----------

##### 5. Why “Concatenate”?

-   **Concatenate** = “link together.”
    
-   `cat` links file-buffers or pipe-buffers end-to-end and shows you the whole chain.
    

----------

##### Quick-Reference Commands

SSH on default port

`ssh user@host`

SSH on custom port 2222

`ssh -p 2222 user@host`

Show contents of one file

`cat file.txt`

Show multiple files back-to-back

`cat a.txt b.txt`

---
#### Solution
```bash
$ ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
# type, and enter "yes" (without quotes, if necessary)
                         _                     _ _ _
                        | |__   __ _ _ __   __| (_) |_
                        | '_ \ / _` | '_ \ / _` | | __|
                        | |_) | (_| | | | | (_| | | |_
                        |_.__/ \__,_|_| |_|\__,_|_|\__|

Welcome to OverTheWire!

If you find any problems, please report them to the #wargames channel on
discord or IRC.

--[ Playing the games ]--

  This machine might hold several wargames.
  If you are playing "somegame", then:

    * USERNAMES are somegame0, somegame1, ...
    * Most LEVELS are stored in /somegame/.
    * PASSWORDS for each level are stored in /etc/somegame_pass/.

  Write-access to homedirectories is disabled. It is advised to create a
  working directory with a hard-to-guess name in /tmp/.  You can use the
  command "mktemp -d" in order to generate a random and hard to guess
  directory in /tmp/.  Read-access to both /tmp/ is disabled and to /proc
  restricted so that users cannot snoop on eachother. Files and directories
  with easily guessable or short names will be periodically deleted! The /tmp
  directory is regularly wiped.
  Please play nice:

    * don't leave orphan processes running
    * don't leave exploit-files laying around
    * don't annoy other players
    * don't post passwords or spoilers
    * again, DONT POST SPOILERS!
      This includes writeups of your solution on your blog or website!

--[ Tips ]--

  This machine has a 64bit processor and many security-features enabled
  by default, although ASLR has been switched off.  The following
  compiler flags might be interesting:

    -m32                    compile for 32bit
    -fno-stack-protector    disable ProPolice
    -Wl,-z,norelro          disable relro

  In addition, the execstack tool can be used to flag the stack as
  executable on ELF binaries.

  Finally, network-access is limited for most levels by a local
  firewall.

--[ Tools ]--

 For your convenience we have installed a few useful tools which you can find
 in the following locations:

    * gef (https://github.com/hugsy/gef) in /opt/gef/
    * pwndbg (https://github.com/pwndbg/pwndbg) in /opt/pwndbg/
    * gdbinit (https://github.com/gdbinit/Gdbinit) in /opt/gdbinit/
    * pwntools (https://github.com/Gallopsled/pwntools)
    * radare2 (http://www.radare.org/)
