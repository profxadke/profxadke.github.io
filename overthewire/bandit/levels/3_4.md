#### Previously learnt:
SSH Connect to remote host on a custom port, and then read `spaces in this filename` filename making use of `cat` command.

---
#### Task:

Read files inside of a directory, making use of `strings` command and wildcard as a command-line argument.

---
#### Explanation

Here, we're supposed to read the files within a directory inside `inhere` and where the filename starts from `..` making the use of wildcards and `strings` command since we do not wish our terminal to be filled with gibberish cluttered within my [STDOUT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_streams). [`strings`](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/strings.1.html) command is simply used to display "**JUST**" ASCII characters and, ignore <u>"everything else"</u>.

#### BONUS: `tail` command
> It is a command used to see "[tail](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/tail.1.html)" of a file just like "[head](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/head.1.html)" separated by a newline character, see [`$ man tail`](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/tail.1.html) for more info.
