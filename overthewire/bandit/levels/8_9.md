#### Previously learnt:
SSH Connect to remote host on a custom port, then grep/filtering specific keyword while reading either by using `cat` command or using redirections.

#### Task:

As stated and, hinted on OTW: _The password for the next level is stored in the file  **data.txt**  and is the only line of text that occurs only once_. Perform the necessary task to advance to next level.

#### Explanation

##### Quick Summary

You take a jumble of lines, use [`sort`](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/sort.1.html) to line them up in order (so duplicates sit next to each other), then use [`uniq`](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/uniq.1.html) to squish away the extra copies—leaving just one of each.

##### How It Works

1.  **`sort`**
    
    -   Think of your lines as colored blocks dropped in random order.
        
    -   `sort` arranges all the blocks by color (or text) from A to Z, so identical ones end up side-by-side.
        
2.  **`uniq`**
    
    -   Now that identical blocks are neighbors, `uniq` walks down the line and removes any block that’s the same as the one before it—keeping only the first of each group.
        

```bash
sort file.txt | uniq

```

-   The pipe `|` takes the sorted output and feeds it straight into `uniq` without making a new file.
    

##### Example

File `fruits.txt` contains:

```
apple  
banana  
apple  
cherry  
banana  

```

```bash
sort fruits.txt | uniq
# Output:
apple  
banana  
cherry  

```

-   **Step 1**: `sort` →
    
    ```
    apple  
    apple  
    banana  
    banana  
    cherry  
    
    ```
    
-   **Step 2**: `uniq` →
    
    ```
    apple  
    banana  
    cherry  
    
    ```
